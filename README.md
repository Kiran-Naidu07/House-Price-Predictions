🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression This project aims to predict house prices using Linear Regression, one of the simplest yet effective machine learning algorithms for regression tasks. It is ideal for beginners to understand the end-to-end workflow of a supervised learning project.

📦 Features Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing and feature selection

Model building using Linear Regression

Model evaluation using metrics like R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Visualizations for better understanding of model performance

🛠️ Tech Stack Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Dataset The project uses a publicly available house price dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or Scikit-learn datasets). It includes features like:

Number of bedrooms

Area (in sq.ft)

Location

Age of the house

Other relevant attributes
